// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

interface Car {
  manufacturer: string;
  model: string;
  [key: string]: string | number | boolean;
}

function createCar(
  manufacturer: string,
  model: string,
  ...options: [string, string | number | boolean][]
): Car {
  const car: Car = {
    manufacturer,
    model,
  };

  for (const [key, value] of options) {
    car[key] = value;
  }

  return car;
}

// Call the function with required information and additional key-value pairs
const myCar = createCar(
  "Toyota",
  "Camry",
  ["color", "blue"],
  ["hasSunroof", true]
);

// Print the resulting object
console.log(myCar);
