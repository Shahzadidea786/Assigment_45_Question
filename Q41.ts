// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

// Function to show magicians
function showMagicians(magicians: string[]): void {
  for (const magician of magicians) {
    console.log(magician);
  }
}

// Function to make magicians great
function makegreat(magicians: string[]): string[] {
  return magicians.map((magician) => `${magician} the Great`);
}

// Array of magician's names
const magicianNames1: string[] = [
  "David Copperfield",
  "Houdini",
  "Derren Brown",
  "Penn & Teller",
];

// Call make_great to modify the array
const greatMagicians: string[] = makegreat(magicianNames1);

// Call show_magicians to see the modified list
showMagicians(greatMagicians);
